The discipline of computer vision has for many years been dominated by individual task dependent algorithms. However we want to develop a generalized computer vision system were multiple tasks may share common results. To do this a structure refereed to as deep hierarchy is implemented. The implementation of this structure is made possible indeed by the development of multi-core processors. This structure furthermore enables the possibility of faster processing with less storage needs.
