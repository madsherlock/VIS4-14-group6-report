\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Deep hierarichal networks can be used for object recognition in computer vision systems,
and it is possible to build these hierarchies through unsupervised learning.
The use of hierarichal compositional structures allow for efficient object recognition,
as it inherently reduces the problem-space, both in terms of the number
of objects to match an image against, and in the internal space consumption of the implementation.
In addition to this, the hierarichal structure is well suited for parallel processing,
and allows for a generalized computer vision system.
